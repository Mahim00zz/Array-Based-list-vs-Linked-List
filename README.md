# Array-Based-list-vs-Linked-List
In this project we focus on Array Based list and Linked List. We compare their test times and storage consumptions and determine the best based on different cases. The test cases are: AddSortedOdd, AddSortedEven, AddAll, AddAllAtIndexZero, RemoveAllEven, RemoveAllOdd.
